  // twice, so why not just read the slot table directly? As opaque as the Group API is, the actual
  // slot table API is quite complicated, and the actual format of the slot table (effectively an
  // array that stores a flattened version of a composition tree) is super low level. It's likely to
  // change a lot between compose versions, and keeping up with that with every two-week dev release
  // would be a lot of work. Additionally, a lot of the objects stored in the slot table are not
  // public (eg LayoutNode), so we'd need to use even more (brittle) reflection to do that parsing.
  // That said, once Compose is more stable, it might be worth it to read the slot table directly,
  // since then we could drop the requirement for the Tooling library to be on the classpath.
